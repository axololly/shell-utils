# Shell Utilities [`v1.0.1`](./CHANGELOG.md#v101-101)

A series of programs I wrote for my Windows client to do neat things I'm too lazy to that were written in C++.

Come and see [the changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for everything I've added to this.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have MinGW installed, go for the binaries in [`bin/`](./bin/). If not, use [`bin/share/`](./bin/share/).
